                  I'm a Software Engineer who recently graduated from Rochester Institute of Technology.
                  When I think about Software Engineering I like to think about how much we don't know what's happening around us.
                  I'm curious about a lot of things I can't see and that's what drew me towards Backend Engineering specifically. Making a change even if its not visual goes a long way.

                  Since I was a kid, electronic music has been a part of my life. Now I like to mix techno and picked up DJing as a hobby.

                  Photography has interested me ever since I picked up a smarthphone.
